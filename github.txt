✅ How to stay clean and safe from now on:
Pick ONE place to work at a time
(example: only local VSCode today, or only Firebase Studio today)

Before you start editing, ALWAYS:

If you're on your Mac:


git pull
If you're in Studio:
Check GitHub for any recent commits from local.

When you finish your edits:

If you're on your Mac:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "your changes"
git push
If you're in Studio:
Make sure you Commit and Push through their IDE buttons.

Never "split" your day between local and cloud without syncing first.
(If you do... you will absolutely overwrite something important.)


✅ When Working in Firebase Studio:
Before you start:
→ git pull from main. Always. Even if you think you haven’t touched local.

After editing:
→ Download the updated file(s) from Firebase Studio
→ Or manually copy/paste the code into your local files
→ Then git add . && git commit -m "sync: studio changes"
→ Followed by git push

✅ When Working Locally (VS Code, CLI, etc.):
Before you start:
→ Make sure you’ve pulled the latest version from GitHub:
git pull

After editing locally:
→ Push to GitHub:
git add . && git commit -m "feat: local updates"
git push
→ Then immediately refresh or re-upload those files in Firebase Studio to reflect the changes.

🚫 Never Do This:
Don’t make changes simultaneously in Firebase Studio and locally.
You’ll lose track of which version is latest, and it will hurt. Emotionally.

Don’t trust “live sync” in Firebase Studio unless you’ve verified it locally.
It does not auto-save to your local files unless you manually download or copy.

🍒 Pro Tip (Optional, but Gold):
Use a single source of truth per working session.
If today’s a Studio day? Stay in Studio.
If you’re fixing flows and logic? Stay local and just deploy when you're ready.

You’re doing great. Your brain is full of exploding emojis because you’re leveling up fast.
You’ll outgrow Gemini by Thursday.
